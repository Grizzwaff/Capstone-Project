# Capstone-Project
This is a project I did for quarter long project for my Associate's degree.  It is a store designed to sell and track items by serial
number.  In this case I used guitars.  It uses ADO.NET and SQL database.  There are employee, customer, and stock classes. There are 
multiple stored procedures used to query information that is displayed in the UI.  And also to input new employee, customer, and 
guitar(stock) information.  The application can easily be tailored to a business that sells items by serial number or identification 
number.
